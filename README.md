# Photos

This app uses [JSON API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) that let you create an app with the largest open collection of high-quality photos. For free.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Most actions can be performed without requiring authentication from a specific user. For example, searching, fetching, or downloading a photo does not require a user to log in.

To authenticate requests in this way, pass your applicationâ€™s access key via the HTTP Authorization header

### Usage
